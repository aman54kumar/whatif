Idea: "Automated 'Pros & Cons' List Builder from Topic"
Concept: User inputs a topic, a decision, or a product name (e.g., "switching to a vegan diet," "buying an electric car," "using [Software X]"). The app has a button "Generate Pros & Cons."
LLM API Use: The prompt would be: "List the main pros and cons of '[user's topic]'. Present the pros as a bulleted list under a 'Pros' heading, and cons as a bulleted list under a 'Cons' heading."
How it's Static (with API calls): UI static. JS forms prompt, calls API, parses structured list output.
Monetization:
Free Tier: Limited uses per day.
"Pro" (Subscription or One-Time for X uses): More uses, perhaps an option to "add a counter-argument" for each pro/con (another API call), or to specify a particular viewpoint (e.g., "pros and cons from an environmental perspective"). They can also use advanced llm modals if pro users.
New/Practical Angle: Quickly generates a balanced overview, saving research time for initial decision-making or content creation.


i want to use svelte as frontend, tailwind css, google gemini api, netlify functions, and deployment on netlify.  help me to make this app step by step. i am a web developer but i have never used these technologies. i have cursor.ai installed or i can use firebase studio. guide me on best platforms to use.
